G Cost is the cost of movement from the starting square to current square.
It is equal to one plus the cost of movement from the previous square.

H Cost is the estimated cost of movement from the current square to the final square.
The way H Cost is calculated in the screenshot is by the Manhattan distance method. 

F Cost is the sum of the G Cost and H Cost per square.
Each square has it's own F Cost.
